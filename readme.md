# TMS — Transportation Management System

A modular **Transportation Management System (TMS)** backend built with Java and Spring Boot.
The system manages shipment lifecycles, pricing calculations, validation pipelines, authentication, and event-driven messaging.

The architecture focuses on **clean separation of concerns, extensible rule engines, and scalable messaging**, making it easy to extend the system with new carriers, pricing rules, and shipment workflows.

# Core Features

## Shipment Management

* Create shipments
* Update shipment details
* Track shipment lifecycle
* Status transition management
* Shipment filtering and pagination

Shipments support multiple attributes including:

* Dimensions
* Weight
* Delivery type
* Tracking information
* Shipment status lifecycle

---

# Pricing Engine

Pricing logic is implemented using a **rule-based pipeline**.

Each rule operates on a shared context object and modifies pricing data incrementally.

Example pricing rules:

* Chargeable weight calculation
* Slab pricing
* Fuel surcharge
* GST calculation
* International shipment handling
* Delivery percentage adjustments

Rules are modular and easily extendable.

Example rules:

* `ChargeableWeightRule`
* `FuelSurchargeRule`
* `GstRule`
* `InternationalRule`
* `SlabPricingRule`

All rules implement a shared interface:

```
CalculationRule
```

The rules operate on a shared:

```
PricingContext
```

This allows rules to be chained and executed sequentially.

---

# Shipment Validation Engine

Before a shipment is created or updated, it passes through a **validation rule pipeline**.

Each validation rule validates a specific business constraint.

Example validation rules:

* Backdating prevention
* Status transition validation
* Terminal state immutability
* Tracking number immutability
* Physical attribute validation
* Delivery type validation
* Date consistency checks

Rules operate on:

```
ShipmentValidationContext
```

and implement:

```
ShipmentValidationRule
```

This allows validation logic to remain **modular, reusable, and easy to extend**.

---

# Authentication & Security

Authentication includes:

* User signup
* Login
* JWT access token generation
* Refresh token rotation
* Email verification
* Password reset

Security is implemented using **Spring Security filters and JWT tokens**.

Key components:

* `JwtAuthenticationFilter`
* `JwtService`
* `CustomUserDetailsService`
* `CustomUserPrincipal`

---

# GraphQL API

The system exposes a **GraphQL API** for all operations.

Example operations include:

### Authentication

```
signup
login
verifyEmail
resetPassword
```

### Shipments

```
createShipment
updateShipment
shipment
shipments
```

GraphQL DTOs are organized into:

* Input DTOs
* Output DTOs
* Filters
* Pagination models

---

# Redis Rate Limiting

GraphQL resolvers are protected using **Redis-based rate limiting**.

Rate limiting supports:

* IP-based limiting for unauthenticated requests
* User-based limiting for authenticated users
* Per-resolver rate limit configuration

Redis is hosted using **Upstash Redis**.

Example configuration:

```
redis.host=${REDIS_HOST}
redis.port=${REDIS_PORT}
redis.username=${REDIS_USERNAME}
redis.password=${REDIS_PASSWORD}
redis.ssl=true
```

Environment variables:

```
REDIS_HOST
REDIS_PORT
REDIS_USERNAME
REDIS_PASSWORD
```

---

# Messaging Architecture (RabbitMQ)

The system uses **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous messaging and event-driven processing.

Messaging is used for:

* Shipment tracking updates
* Event-driven workflows
* Future integrations with external systems

Messaging components include:

* Publishers
* Consumers
* Message models
* RabbitMQ configuration

This allows decoupled services and improved scalability.
